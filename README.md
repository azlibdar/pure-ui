## Contribution
We welcome contributions from developers who share our passion for building clean and responsive UIs using only pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Do not use any external libraries like Tailwind CSS, React, or any other framework.
Designs should be responsive and accessible across different devices.
Let's collaborate to create a library of beautiful and functional UI components using pure code!

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Happy coding! üêß
